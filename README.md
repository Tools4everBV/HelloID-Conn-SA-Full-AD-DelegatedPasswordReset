# üìÅ Repository Status: Archiving Notice

Dear Contributors,

The 'all-in-one' creation scripts are currently non-functional, indicating that this form/repository is no longer in active use. Consequently, we have decided to archive this repository. Unfortunately, due to our lack of utilization and the non-operational state of the current scripts, we are unable to easily split this repository into two separate ones.

Should there still be a demand for and reliance on this repository, we are open to unarchiving it. However, this process will necessitate the involvement of someone actively engaged with and utilizing this repository to overhaul its contents.

Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.

## Description
This set of HelloID Service Automation Delegated Forms provides a way to delegate selected AD Groups permission to reset passwords of accounts in specified Organizational Units.

There are two delegated apps:
  1. Delegated PW Reset Config - This Delegated Form App provides a way to add, update, and remove associations between Groups and AD Organizational Units (including sub OUs).  Access to this app should be limited to admins.
  2. Delegated PW Reset - This Delegated Form App displays a list of selectable users, populated from the OU's the requesting user's group memberships are associated to.  A single user can be selected and new password specified.  Upon submitting the form, the selected account's password is reset, and their account is unlocked.  Access to this form does not need to be as restricted, as the list of selectable users is controlled by the requester's own Group memberships.
